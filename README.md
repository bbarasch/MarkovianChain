Markovian Chain with input file

This is a simple Markovian chain I made. probMatrix.java generates a probability matrix out of a word document provided by the user.
Markovian.java prints out a chain constructed from the probability matrix.
In layman terms, a Markovian chain like the one I've made chain together words randomly and analyzing the probability that any given word will come before another word, thus chaining words with the scope of 1 word per chain. While the sentences have correct syntax, the sentences generally don't make much sense since the only scope the program can see is the word directly behind it. Length of sentences varries wildly depending on when it hits an end of sentence word.
